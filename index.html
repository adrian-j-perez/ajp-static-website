    Using this index.html to redirect to home.html
    
    Two reasons for this approach:
        
        1.	Using GitHub pages to host website. So when going directly to base url (without any paths) it looks for an index file, else it throws a 404 error code.
        
        2.	Maintain folder structure â€“ keeping html files in one spot, did not what to have html files in the root directory.
