    Using this ./index.html to redirect to ./page/home.html

    Two reasons for this approach:
        
        1.	Using GitHub pages to host website as a static. So when going directly to host base url (without any paths) it looks for an index.html, else it will throw a 404 error code.
        
        2.	Maintain folder structure â€“ keeping html files in one spot, did not what to have html files in the root directory.
