# Welcome

Hello and welcome to my website that I built from scratch. The purpose of this website is to host some sort of portfolio or hold blogging notes for myself. I might include some projects that I have done in the past or anything that I am currently doing such as reporting my roadblocks and how I overcome the issue. I believe writing it down is more to my benefit than anything else, as I might encounter the same problem in the future, and I forgot how I solve it in the past (^_____^). 

Feel free to explore as you can see, there are tabs that you can click on the top right to learn more.
