### My Favorite Hobby

When I have time for my hobbies, my favorite one is watching tv or some kind of videos like going on YouTube there is something about this that I find relaxing. This hobby is quite simple compared to some of my other hobbies, all I have to do is just lay on the couch and turn on the tv, but this hobby can get old pretty fast if there is not anything interesting to watch. So, some other hobbies of mine are playing some video games with my peers, going through social media (looking at memes), practicing the trumpet, and messing around with computers. These are some of my current hobbies that I like to do when I find myself with free time.
